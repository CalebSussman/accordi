# Session Log - December 13, 2025

## Session: 12:00 PM

### Changes Made:

**Files Modified:**
1. `backend/omr.py` - Added PDF-to-PNG conversion for OEMER processing
2. `backend/requirements.txt` - Added pdf2image dependency
3. `Dockerfile` - Added poppler-utils system package

**Specific Changes:**

#### backend/omr.py (lines 134-240)
- Added PDF-to-image conversion using pdf2image library
- OEMER only accepts image files (PNG, JPG), not PDFs
- Converts first page of PDF to PNG at 300 DPI before OEMER processing
- Saves temporary PNG file in output directory
- Passes PNG to OEMER CLI instead of PDF
- Cleans up temporary PNG file after processing
- Added error handling for missing pdf2image import

#### backend/requirements.txt
- Added `pdf2image==1.17.0` for PDF to image conversion

#### Dockerfile
- Added `poppler-utils` to system dependencies (required by pdf2image)

**Dependencies Added:**
- pdf2image==1.17.0 (Python package)
- poppler-utils (system package via apt-get)

### Testing Performed:

**Not yet deployed** - Changes pending commit and Render deployment

**Expected Test:**
1. Upload PDF via web interface
2. Backend converts PDF to PNG
3. OEMER processes PNG file
4. Returns MusicXML output

### Issues Encountered:

**Issue 1: OEMER API Misunderstanding (Resolved in previous session)**
- Problem: Used `oemer.ommr()` which doesn't exist
- Error: `module 'oemer' has no attribute 'ommr'`
- Resolution: Changed to use OEMER CLI via subprocess

**Issue 2: OEMER Doesn't Accept PDF Files**
- Problem: OEMER only accepts image files, threw `PIL.UnidentifiedImageError`
- Error: `cannot identify image file '/app/uploads/716a2fb5-aa72-4cdf-9a56-e58acdef2b3c.pdf'`
- Resolution: Added PDF-to-PNG conversion step using pdf2image

### Next Steps:

1. Commit changes with message describing PDF-to-image conversion fix
2. Push to main branch to trigger Render deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Test end-to-end: PDF upload → PNG conversion → OEMER processing → MusicXML output
5. Monitor logs for any errors
6. If successful, test with various sheet music PDFs
7. Optional: Implement Audiveris Google Cloud Run deployment per `ref/audiveris_cloud_run_plan.md`

### Blockers/Dependencies:

- None currently
- Waiting for deployment to test changes

## Session: 3:00 PM

### Changes Made:

**Files Modified:**
1. `backend/omr.py` - Increased timeout and added better logging/error handling

**Specific Changes:**

#### backend/omr.py
- **Increased default timeout from 300s (5 min) to 600s (10 min)** (line 111)
  - OEMER takes 3-5 minutes with GPU according to docs
  - Without GPU (Render free tier), it takes longer
  - Updated docstring to reflect new timeout and reasoning

- **Added comprehensive logging for OEMER process** (lines 205-227)
  - Log when process starts and completes
  - Log process return code
  - Log first 500 chars of stdout/stderr for debugging
  - Better timeout error handling with process cleanup

- **Improved MusicXML file detection** (lines 239-255)
  - Check for both `.musicxml` and `.xml` extensions
  - List all output files if expected file not found
  - Provide detailed error message showing what was expected vs what was generated

### Testing Performed:

**Not yet deployed** - Changes pending commit

**Expected Behavior:**
- OEMER should now have enough time to complete processing (10 min vs 5 min)
- Better logs will help diagnose if it's still timing out or failing for another reason
- If output file has different extension, we'll catch it now

### Issues Encountered:

**Issue 3: OEMER Process Timeout**
- Problem: OEMER was timing out during processing, never completing
- User error: "Load failed" with logs showing conversion to PNG succeeded but then infinite status polling
- Root Cause:
  - OEMER documentation states it takes 3-5 minutes with GPU
  - Render free tier likely doesn't have GPU, causing longer processing time
  - Default 5-minute timeout insufficient
- Resolution:
  - Increased timeout to 10 minutes
  - Added comprehensive logging to capture stdout/stderr
  - Improved error messages and file detection

### Research Findings:

**OEMER CLI Documentation:**
- Basic usage: `oemer <path_to_image> -o <output_dir>`
- Options: `-h`, `--help`, `-o/--output-path`, `--use-tf`, `--save-cache`, `-d/--without-deskew`
- Output: Creates MusicXML file and analysis image in output directory
- Performance: 3-5 min with GPU, 10+ min without GPU on first run (checkpoint downloads)
- Source: https://github.com/BreezeWhite/oemer

### Next Steps:

1. Commit timeout fix and improved logging
2. Push to trigger Render deployment
3. Test with PDF upload - monitor logs for OEMER stdout/stderr
4. If still timing out, may need to investigate OEMER checkpoint downloads
5. Consider adding `--save-cache` flag to speed up subsequent runs

### Blockers/Dependencies:

- None currently
- May hit timeout even with 10 minutes if checkpoints need to download
- May need to pre-download OEMER checkpoints in Dockerfile
